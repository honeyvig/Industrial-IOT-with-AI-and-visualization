================
To help you develop the IoT and AI-driven solution as described in your job outline, I’ll provide a Python code sample and architecture that incorporates the requirements, focusing on IoT data ingestion, cloud integration, visualization, and AI tools for workflow enhancement. This code is designed to integrate with platforms like Ubidots, Node-RED, Grafana, and AWS services like Lambda and S3.
1. Edge Device to Cloud Data Pipeline:

The code below demonstrates how you might set up a data pipeline using Python, integrating IoT devices (e.g., LoRaWAN, Digi XBee, or ESP32) and cloud platforms like Ubidots for device management and visualization.
IoT Data Collection and Transmission (Python Example)

Here, we collect data from an IoT sensor and send it to a cloud platform (e.g., Ubidots) for visualization.

import time
import requests
import random
import json

# Ubidots API URL
UBIDOTS_API_URL = "https://industrial.api.ubidots.com/api/v1.6/devices/{}/values/"

# Your Ubidots Token (replace with your own API key)
UBIDOTS_TOKEN = "YOUR_UBIDOTS_API_KEY"

# Example IoT device data (sensor readings)
def generate_sensor_data():
    return {
        'temperature': round(random.uniform(20.0, 30.0), 2),
        'humidity': round(random.uniform(30.0, 80.0), 2),
        'pressure': round(random.uniform(900.0, 1100.0), 2)
    }

# Function to send data to Ubidots
def send_data_to_ubidots(device_label, sensor_data):
    headers = {'X-Auth-Token': UBIDOTS_TOKEN}
    payload = {'temperature': sensor_data['temperature'], 'humidity': sensor_data['humidity'], 'pressure': sensor_data['pressure']}
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(UBIDOTS_API_URL.format(device_label), headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()  # If response code is not 200, raise an exception
        print(f"Data sent to Ubidots: {sensor_data}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error sending data to Ubidots: {e}")

# Main loop: Send data to Ubidots every 10 seconds
if __name__ == "__main__":
    device_label = "my-iot-device"  # Replace with actual device label in Ubidots

    while True:
        sensor_data = generate_sensor_data()
        send_data_to_ubidots(device_label, sensor_data)
        time.sleep(10)

    Explanation: The code generates random sensor data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) and sends it to Ubidots using their API. The data is sent every 10 seconds.
    Next Step: On the cloud, you'll visualize this data using Ubidots dashboards, Grafana, or ECharts as needed.

2. Node-RED IoT Flow:

In Node-RED, you can build IoT integration workflows. This example assumes the flow involves reading sensor data and sending it to the cloud.

    Data Flow:
        Input Node: An MQTT node listens to the data from sensors.
        Processing Node: Data can be processed (e.g., cleaning or aggregating).
        Output Node: The processed data is sent to Ubidots via an HTTP request.

[{"id":"mqtt_in","type":"mqtt in","z":"flow_id","name":"Sensor Data","topic":"sensors/data","qos":"2","datatype":"json","broker":"mqtt_broker_id","x":140,"y":100,"wires":[["http_request_node"]]},{"id":"http_request_node","type":"http request","z":"flow_id","name":"Send to Ubidots","method":"POST","ret":"obj","url":"https://industrial.api.ubidots.com/api/v1.6/devices/my-iot-device/values/","headers":[{"name":"X-Auth-Token","value":"YOUR_UBIDOTS_API_KEY"}],"body":"{\"temperature\": \"{{payload.temperature}}\",\"humidity\": \"{{payload.humidity}}\",\"pressure\": \"{{payload.pressure}}\"}","x":360,"y":100,"wires":[["debug"]]},{"id":"debug","type":"debug","z":"flow_id","name":"Debug","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"true","x":570,"y":100,"wires":[]}]

    Explanation: This Node-RED flow listens to MQTT messages and sends the data to Ubidots. It also handles temperature, humidity, and pressure data.

3. Building Real-time Dashboards with Grafana:

Once the data is being sent to a time-series database like InfluxDB, Grafana can be used to visualize the data.
InfluxDB Integration in Grafana:

Set up Grafana to query InfluxDB where your time-series data (sensor data) is stored.

    InfluxDB Setup:

from influxdb import InfluxDBClient

# Setup the InfluxDB client
client = InfluxDBClient(host='localhost', port=8086)
client.switch_database('sensor_data')

# Example: Inserting a data point
json_body = [
    {
        "measurement": "sensor_readings",
        "tags": {
            "device": "my-iot-device"
        },
        "fields": {
            "temperature": 22.5,
            "humidity": 65.0,
            "pressure": 1010.0
        }
    }
]
client.write_points(json_body)

Grafana Visualization:

Create a dashboard to visualize the data. Grafana can connect to InfluxDB and query the data to display on charts and graphs. You can configure alerts, thresholds, and trends over time.
4. AI Integration for Predictive Maintenance:

For predictive maintenance, AI/ML models can be used to predict when an IoT device might fail based on time-series data. Below is a simple example using scikit-learn for predictive maintenance based on sensor data.

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

# Sample training data (features could be temperature, humidity, etc.)
X_train = np.array([[22.1, 65], [23.0, 60], [21.5, 55], [24.5, 70], [22.8, 60]])
y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])  # 0 = normal, 1 = potential failure

# Train a random forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on new data
new_data = np.array([[23.5, 68]])  # Example: New sensor reading
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

if prediction == 1:
    print("Warning: Potential failure detected!")
else:
    print("Device is operating normally.")

    Explanation: The machine learning model predicts whether a sensor reading indicates potential device failure. You can adapt this model with more features and real-world sensor data.

5. Leveraging AI for Workflow Optimization:

Using tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini can significantly enhance the development workflow by generating code snippets, optimizing tasks, assisting with documentation, and providing insights into best practices.

Example with ChatGPT:

    Generate Python code snippets for new IoT integrations.
    Assist in writing technical documentation.
    Offer suggestions for optimizing algorithms or data handling strategies.

Summary

The code examples provided focus on the following key tasks:

    Data ingestion and cloud integration (IoT devices to Ubidots).
    Visualization of time-series data using Grafana and InfluxDB.
    Predictive maintenance using machine learning models to analyze sensor data for potential failures.
    Automation of workflows leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT for faster development.

This will help you build a scalable and efficient IIoT solution, from edge devices to cloud services, with a focus on real-time data, predictive maintenance, and seamless integrations.
